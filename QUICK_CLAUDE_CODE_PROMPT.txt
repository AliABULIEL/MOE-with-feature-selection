Fix olmoe_routing_experiments.py - all 500 samples failing because router_logits aren't being captured.

ISSUE: Current code uses `output_router_logits=True` which doesn't work. All samples skip with errors.

SOLUTION FROM OLMOE_TESTS.IPYNB: Use forward hooks instead!

The working notebook (Olmoe_tests.ipynb) shows the correct approach in Cell 7:
1. Register hooks on layer.mlp.gate for each layer
2. Hooks capture router_logits directly during forward pass
3. NO need for output_router_logits=True

REQUIRED CHANGES:

1. Model loading - simplify like notebook Cell 5:
   ```python
   model = OlmoeForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_id, torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16)
   # NO output_router_logits parameter!
   ```

2. Add hook system (based on notebook Cell 7):
   - Register forward hooks on each layer.mlp.gate
   - Hooks capture router_logits automatically during forward()
   - Store in instance variable
   - Clear between samples to avoid memory issues

3. In evaluate_configuration:
   - Replace `outputs.router_logits` usage with hook-captured data
   - Hooks populate data automatically during forward pass

4. Fix error handling - log first 5 errors with details instead of silent counting

KEY: The notebook proves this works! It successfully captures routing data using hooks, not output_router_logits. Copy that pattern.

TEST: expert_counts=[4], strategies=['baseline'], datasets=['wikitext'], max_samples=10
Should process samples successfully instead of skipping all 500.
